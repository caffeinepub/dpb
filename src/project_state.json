    "PWA installability depends on correct web app manifest (name/start_url/display), valid icon sizes, and service worker lifecycle; aggressive caching can delay updates and keep showing 'Create shortcut'."

  "known_issues": [
    "On Android/Chrome the app still shows 'Create shortcut' instead of 'Install app', and the install/logo icon is missing on some devices (likely manifest/icon/service worker cache/installability criteria)."
